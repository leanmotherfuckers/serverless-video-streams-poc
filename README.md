# Serverless Video Streams POC

This is a simple proof-of-concept showing how to set up a serverless infrastructure for automatically converting MP4 videos into a HLS video stream (m3u8) with support for multiple different frame rates.


## Architecture

<p align="center"><img src=".github/stack.png" alt="Cloudformation diagram" height="420" /></p>

1. User drops MP4 file in the directory `input/` in the S3 bucket.
2. This will trigger a Lambda called `convert` that A) initiates a MediaConvert job and B) saves a record in DynamoDB with `conversionStatus = created` and with a `streamUrl` defined.
3. MediaConvert will trigger multiple events along the way that get sent to a SNS topic.
4. A Lambda called `updateDatabase` is subscribed to this SNS topic, and will update the `conversionStatus` value in DynamoDB for the video.
5. MediaConvert finishes the conversion and places all streaming assets (m3u8 files and stream chunks for multiple bitrates0 in the `output/` directory in the S3 bucket.
6. This `output/` directory of the bucket is publicly accessible via CloudFront. The URL for the CloudFront-hosted `m3u8` stream entrypoint can be retrieved from DynamoDB.


## Details

### Video quality
The stream is stored with various sizes/quality settings. More can be added in `src/utils/videoConfig.js`:

```js
const outputProfiles = {
    // View full list here:
    // https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/home?region=eu-west-1#/presets/list
    // (choose 'System presets' instead of 'Custom presets')
    '/1080p': 'System-Avc_16x9_1080p_29_97fps_8500kbps',
    '/720p': 'System-Avc_16x9_720p_29_97fps_3500kbps',
    '/480p': 'System-Avc_4x3_480p_29_97fps_600kbps'
};
```

The video player will automatically detect these and choose the one that best suits the user's network speed.


### Segment length & other HSL settings
These can be customized in the same `videoConfig.js` file. Might be interesting to play around with segment length, which is currently set to 4 seconds. Apple seems to recommend 6 seconds, but this creates rather big files (around 9MB per segment at 1080p quality).

```js
const hlsSettings = {
    ManifestDurationFormat: 'INTEGER',
    SegmentLength: 4,
    TimedMetadataId3Period: 10,
    CaptionLanguageSetting: 'OMIT',
    TimedMetadataId3Frame: 'PRIV',
    CodecSpecification: 'RFC_4281',
    OutputSelection: 'MANIFESTS_AND_SEGMENTS',
    ProgramDateTimePeriod: 600,
    MinSegmentLength: 0,
    DirectoryStructure: 'SINGLE_DIRECTORY',
    ProgramDateTime: 'EXCLUDE',
    SegmentControl: 'SEGMENTED_FILES',
    ManifestCompression: 'NONE',
    ClientCache: 'ENABLED',
    StreamInfResolution: 'INCLUDE'
};
```

### MediaConvert DescribeEndpoints Limit Rate
Note that there is a rate limit of 0.01667 TPS (Once per 60 seconds) for DescribeEndpoints.

```let { Endpoints } = await mediaconvert.describeEndpoints({ MaxResults: 0, }).promise();```

Requesting it too often will result in `AccessDeniedException` error.

Since this endpoint ties to your account and stays the same, it is recommended by AWS that you only request it once, then cache or hardcode it.
Alternatively, you can also find the endpoint on AWS console at `Console > AWS Elemental MediaConvert > Account > API endpoint`.

### Testing video stream

There are several test-players that can be used to verify a HLS stream is functional, like [this one from Castr](https://castr.io/hlsplayer).


## Deploying to your AWS account

1. Run `yarn`
2. Run `yarn deploy`

This will create all necessary pieces of the architecture. 

_Note: since this includes a Cloudfront distribution, the first deploy might take up to 15 minutes. Subsequent ones should take less than a minute._
